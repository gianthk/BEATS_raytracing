\subsection{ML coatings}
Following the increase in ML length to 500 mm the d-spacing of the high-energy stripe is changed back from 2.5 nm to 3.0 nm. This gives approx. +50\% int. reflectivity (dE/E increases from 2.3\% to 3.2\%). Thanks to the increased mirror length the whole vertical beam is intercepted even at min. grazing. \\
Coating specs of the two ML stripes are given in Table \ref{tab:coatings}.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[bhp]{|p{0.4\textwidth} | p{0.3\textwidth} | p{0.3\textwidth} |}
\hline
 & \textbf{STRIPE 1} & \textbf{STRIPE 2} \\
 & \textbf{$[W/B_{4}C]_{100} - d 3.0 nm $} & \textbf{$[Ru/B_{4}C]_{65} - d 4.0 nm $} \\

\subsection{Thermal stability}
The thermal stability of ML1 should be verified with FEA simulations considering the white beam colliding with the mirror at the maximum Bragg angle allowed by the Bragg stage motorization (34.9 mrad). The thermal stability of the cooled mask in front of the ML1 profile shall be also verified.\\
