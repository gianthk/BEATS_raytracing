\subsection{Substrate design}
The center of the first multilayer mirror of the BEATS DMM is positioned at 15.165 m from the ID photon source. \\
CINEL proposed to increase the ML length to 500 mm. A drawing of the proposed substrate is attached.

\subsection{Thermal stability}
The thermal stability of ML1 should be verified with FEA simulations considering the white beam colliding with the mirror at the maximum Bragg angle allowed by the Bragg stage motorization (34.9 mrad). The thermal stability of the cooled mask in front of the ML1 profile shall be also verified.\\

The power density profile at 15.165 m from source is shown in Figure \ref{fig:power_profile_ML1}. Raw data can be found in the \powerprofilesurl. \\
