\section{Crotch absorber}
\subsection{Raytracing}
For the power density of the input beam the contribution from two SESAME bending magnets (upstream and downstream of the ID) was considered in addition to the BEATS 3PW. The modified magnetic field profile used for the calculation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:modifiedfieldprofile}. \\

\subsection{Design}
The crotch absorber entrance is positioned 4.1 m from the ID photon source. We will modify one of the existing SESAME absorbers and machine an aperture of $12.3mm \times 3.28 mm$, for an acceptance of $3.0 mrad \times 0.8  mrad$. 

\subsection{Input beam}
The power density profile of the beam at the crotch absorber entrance is shown in Figure \ref{fig:power_profile_crotch}. Raw data can be found in the \powerprofilesurl. \\
